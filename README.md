# matplotlib-challenge

In this project I use python to visualize results of a mock drug treatment study. In the study mice were treated using a variety oif drug regimes over 45 days. Their physiological responses were monitored over the course of that time.

In order to compare treatments I use Pandas and Matplotlib to:
```
  -Create a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
  -Create a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
  -Create a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
  -Create a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
  ```
