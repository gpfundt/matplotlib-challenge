# matplotlib-challenge

In this project I use python to analyze and visualize results of a drug treatment study. In the study mice were treated using a variety of drug regimes over 45 days. Their physiological responses were monitored over the course of the time.

In order to compare treatments I use Pandas and Matplotlib to create:
```
  -Satter plot showing the tumor volume changes to time for each treatment.
  -Scatter plot showing the number of metastatic sites to time for each treatment.
  -Scatter plot showing the number of surviving mice through the course of treatment.
  -Bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
  ```
